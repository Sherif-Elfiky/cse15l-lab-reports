**Lab Report 4: VIM**

**PART 1**


Commands Used we first use /start to search for start, then we hit enter which jumps to the first entry of start. <br>
Then we say ce which removes start, then we enter base. The we say n which jumps to the next word start, then . to replace that word.<br>
Then again we hit n to jump to the next start, then . to replace that word. Then we are done because all of our starts have been 
modfied to base.
<br>

So the keys we hit are(not including the seperating commas) /start, <enter>, ce, base, n., n. : this is a total of 17 keys pressed.
 If we count saving and quiting the file which has a command of :wq! then we have 21 keys pressed.
