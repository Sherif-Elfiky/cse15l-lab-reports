**Lab Report 4: VIM**

**PART 1**

 
**I Chose to complete Change all the uses of start to base**

Commands Used we first use /start to search for start, then we hit enter which jumps to the first entry of start. <br>
Then we say ce which removes start, then we enter base. The we say n which jumps to the next word start, then . to replace that word.<br>
Then again we hit n to jump to the next start, then . to replace that word. Then we are done because all of our starts have been 
modfied to base.
<br>

So the keys we hit are(not including the seperating commas) /start, <enter>, ce, base, n., n. : this is a total of 17 keys pressed.
 If we count saving and quiting the file which has a command of :wq! then we have 21 keys pressed. <br>
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 *Which of these two styles would you prefer using if you had to work on a program that you were running remotely, and why?* <br>
 I would prefer to make the edits while logged into the remove server. My first reason is the command for scp is very long and I often forget the :~ at the end of the command which can cause issues. <br>
 
 *What about the project or task might factor into your decision one way or another? (If nothing would affect your decision, say so and why!)* <br>
Say there are many files I want to make edits to, I would not want to copy a large amount of files over from my local computer because that can be quite time consuming.
