**Less** <br>
**(1)** <br>
One useful command option is less -N filename <br>
The -N will display line numbers of a file you choose. <br>
Here is an example of me using the code in technical/911report/chapter-1.txt <br>
the terminal commmands: <br>
```
cd technical/911report
less -N chapter-1.txt
```
screenshot: <br>
![less -N](lessn.png)
Here we used less -N to display the file numbers of chapter-1.txt. Note: some of the line numbers are repeated because the screenshot was not fullscreen, so some lines extend to a new line.

**(2)** <br>
Another command with less is 
less -E filename
This command will close the file upon reaching the end of the scroll. This is useful if you want to read through a file and then have it close without having to take time to hit q(quit).
