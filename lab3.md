One useful command option is less -N filename <br>
The -N will display line numbers of a file you choose. <br>
Here is an example of me using the code in technical/911report/chapter-1.txt <br>
the terminal commmands: <br>
```
less -N technical/911report/chapter-1.txt
```

![less -N](lessn.png)
Here we used less -N to display the file numbers of chapter-1.txt. Note: some of the line numbers are repeated because the screenshot was not fullscreen, so some lines extend to a new line.

Lets display the line numbers for technical/government/About_LSC/Comments_on_semiannual.txt. <br>
```
less -N technical/government/About_LSC/Comments_on_semiannual.txt
```
screenshot:
![less -N2](lessn2.png)
Here we have the file Comments_on_semiannual.txt with line numbers shown upon entering the command above. <br>

Lastly we will display the line numbers for technical/biomed/1468-6708-3-3.txt. <br>
```
less -N technical/biomed/1468-6708-3-3.txt 
```
